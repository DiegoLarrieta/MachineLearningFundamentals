# 📈 Linear Regression – A Fundamental Algorithm in Machine Learning

Linear regression is one of the most widely used and fundamental algorithms in supervised machine learning. It’s simple, interpretable, and forms the basis for more complex models.

IT IS NEVER USED AS A CLASIFICATION ALGORITHM

## 🔍 What is Linear Regression?

**Linear regression** is a statistical method used to model the **relationship between a dependent variable (target)** and one or more **independent variables (features)** by fitting a linear equation to the data.

In its simplest form (simple linear regression), the model is:

y = β₀ + β₁x + ε


Where:
- `y` is the predicted output
- `x` is the input feature
- `β₀` is the y-intercept (bias)
- `β₁` is the slope (weight)
- `ε` is the error term (residual)

In **multiple linear regression**, we use several input features:

y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε

## 🎯 What is it used for?

Linear regression is used when we want to **predict a continuous numerical value** based on one or more input features.

It helps us:
- Predict trends
- Understand relationships between variables
- Estimate unknown values
- Perform feature importance analysis (via coefficients)

---

## 📦 What do we get from it?

- A **predictive model** that estimates values of `y` given new values of `x`.
- **Coefficients** that quantify the impact of each feature.
- **Performance metrics** like:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

| Domain          | Application                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Real estate     | Predicting house prices based on size, location, age         |
| Finance         | Estimating future stock prices or company earnings           |
| Health          | Predicting patient risk scores based on medical indicators   |
| Marketing       | Estimating sales based on advertising budget or campaign type|
| Education       | Predicting student performance from study time and attendance|

## 🧰 What do you need to use Linear Regression?

- **A labeled dataset**: input features (`X`) and a numeric target (`y`)
- **Numerical or encoded features** (categorical variables must be encoded)
- Data preprocessing:
  - Handle missing values
  - Feature scaling (optional)
  - Split into training/testing sets
- Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `TensorFlow`, or `PyTorch`

## 🛠️ Applications in Machine Learning Pipelines

- **Baseline model**: often used as a benchmark for regression problems
- **Feature analysis**: helps in understanding which variables influence the output
- **Business intelligence**: provides interpretable models for stakeholders
- **Regularization extensions**: such as Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2)
