# 📈 Linear Regression – A Fundamental Algorithm in Machine Learning

Linear regression is one of the most widely used and fundamental algorithms in supervised machine learning. It’s simple, interpretable, and forms the basis for more complex models.

IT IS NEVER USED AS A CLASIFICATION ALGORITHM

## 🔍 What is Linear Regression?

**Linear regression** is a statistical method used to model the **relationship between a dependent variable (target)** and one or more **independent variables (features)** by fitting a linear equation to the data.

In its simplest form (simple linear regression), the model is:

y = β₀ + β₁x + ε


Where:
- `y` is the predicted output
- `x` is the input feature
- `β₀` is the y-intercept (bias)
- `β₁` is the coefficient (weight)
- `ε` is the error term (residual)

In **multiple linear regression**, we use several input features:

y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε

## 🎯 What is it used for?

Linear regression is used when we want to **predict a continuous numerical value** based on one or more input features.

It helps us:
- Predict trends
- Understand relationships between variables
- Estimate unknown values
- Perform feature importance analysis (via coefficients)

## 📦 What do we get from it?

- A **predictive model**, which is basically a straight line (or plane) that we can use to estimate `y` based on any new `x`. It tells us: “if `x` increases, how does `y` change?”

- **Coefficients**, which are the **slopes** of the line. They tell us **how strongly each input (feature)** affects the output. A high positive value means the feature pushes `y` up; a negative value means it pulls `y` down.

- A **bias term** (also called intercept), which shifts the line **up or down** so that it fits the data better. It’s the prediction when all inputs are zero.

- **Performance metrics**, which help us evaluate how well the model works:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** – how far off the predictions are on average.
  - **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)** – how much of the variability in `y` is explained by the model.

## ✅ What do we get exactly?


At the end of training a linear regression model, we obtain a **mathematical formula** that was learned from the data.

### For a single feature (simple linear regression):

$$
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
$$

### For multiple features (multivariate regression):

$$
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_n x_n
$$

Where:

- $\hat{y}$ is the predicted output
- $x_i$ are the input features
- $\beta_i$ are the learned **coefficients** (slopes or weights)
- $\beta_0$ is the **bias** (intercept)

📌 This formula allows us to **predict new values of `y`** given new inputs `x`.

## 🧰 What do you need to use Linear Regression?

- **A labeled dataset**: input features (`X`) and a numeric target (`y`)
- **Numerical or encoded features** (categorical variables must be encoded)
- Data preprocessing:
  - Handle missing values
  - Feature scaling (optional)
  - Split into training/testing sets
- Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `TensorFlow`, or `PyTorch`

## 🛠️ Applications in Machine Learning Pipelines

- **Baseline model**: often used as a benchmark for regression problems
- **Feature analysis**: helps in understanding which variables influence the output
- **Business intelligence**: provides interpretable models for stakeholders
- **Regularization extensions**: such as Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2)
