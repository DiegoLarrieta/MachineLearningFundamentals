# 🔐 Logistic Regression – A Fundamental Algorithm for Classification

**Logistic Regression** is a supervised learning algorithm used for **binary** (and sometimes multiclass) **classification tasks**.  
Despite its name, it is a **classification model**, not a regression one.

## 📚 What is Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression estimates the **probability** that an input belongs to a certain class (e.g., spam or not spam).  
It models the relationship between input features and the **log-odds** of the outcome using a **sigmoid function**.

> ✅ Output is always between 0 and 1, interpreted as a probability.

---

## 🧠 How Does It Work?

It uses the **logistic (sigmoid) function** to map a linear combination of inputs into a probability:

\[
\hat{y} = \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
\quad \text{where } z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \beta_n x_n
\]

If:
- \( \hat{y} > 0.5 \): predict class 1
- \( \hat{y} \leq 0.5 \): predict class 0

## 🔧 Objective Function: Log-Likelihood

Instead of minimizing mean squared error like in linear regression, logistic regression **maximizes the log-likelihood** of the observed data:

\[
\ell(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i)
\]

This is typically optimized using **Gradient Ascent** or **Gradient Descent** (by minimizing the negative log-likelihood).

## 📈 What Is It Used For?

- Email spam detection (spam vs not spam)
- Customer churn prediction (will leave vs stay)
- Disease diagnosis (positive vs negative)
- Credit approval (approve vs deny)

---

## 🔍 Binary vs Multiclass

- **Binary Logistic Regression**: Two outcomes (0 or 1)
- **Multinomial Logistic Regression**: More than two classes (via softmax)
- **One-vs-Rest (OvR)**: Train multiple binary models for multiclass classification

---

## ✅ Advantages

- ✔️ Simple, fast, and easy to implement
- ✔️ Outputs probabilities (good for ranking & thresholding)
- ✔️ Well-suited for **linearly separable** data
- ✔️ Interpretable coefficients

---

## ❌ Disadvantages

- ❌ Struggles with **non-linear boundaries**
- ❌ Sensitive to **outliers**
- ❌ Assumes **independence between features**
- ❌ Not great for **complex decision surfaces** (use trees or neural nets instead)

## 📊 Logistic vs Linear Regression

| Feature                    | Linear Regression             | Logistic Regression                |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Output                     | Continuous (any real value)   | Probability (between 0 and 1)      |
| Use case                   | Regression (predict numbers)  | Classification (predict classes)   |
| Activation function        | None                          | Sigmoid (logistic function)        |
| Loss function              | MSE                           | Log-Likelihood (cross-entropy)     |
| Threshold-based prediction | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes (e.g., > 0.5 = class 1)     |
